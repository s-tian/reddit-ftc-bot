S1 = <S1> Unsafe Robot and Playing Field Damage - If at any time the Robot operation is deemed unsafe or has damaged the Playing Field or another Robot, by the determination of the referees, the offending Robot may be Disabled and the Team may be issued a Yellow Card. Re-inspection of the Robot is required before it may play another Match.
The intent of this rule is to immediately stop unsafe Robot actions or Playing Field Damage that is likely to persist with continued Robot operation. Robots that are able to continue safe operation without damaging the Playing Field will receive a warning and may continue to play the Match. Robots will be Disabled for unsafe operation or Playing Field Damage that occurs after the first warning for the Tournament.
*S2 = <S2> Robot Extension Outside the Playing Field Perimeter - If any portion of the Robot makes contact with anything Outside the Playing Field Perimeter, the Team will be issued a Yellow Card and it may be Disabled immediately for the remainder of the Match, unless allowed by game-specific rule(s) listed in Section 1.6.3. See the game definitions in section 1.4 for a complete description of the Playing Field Perimeter.
*S3 = <S3> Safety Gear - All members of the Drive Team are required to wear safety glasses and shoes with closed-toes and a closed-back. If any member of the Drive Team is not wearing these safety items, the referee will issue a warning and if the situation is not remedied within thirty seconds, the offending member(s) of the Drive Team must leave the Competition Area for the remainder of the Match and may not be replaced by another Team member. Failure to comply with a request to leave the Competition Area violates rule <G26>.
*G1 = <G1> Drive Team - Each Drive Team shall include up to two Drivers and one Coach. Electronic communications (cell phone, two-way radio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.) by Drive Team members after an Alliance has been called from the queue to the Playing Field for its Match are not allowed. The first instance of violating this rule will result in a warning, with any following instances during the tournament resulting in a Minor Penalty. Items that may be mistaken by a casual observer as being in violation should not be brought to the Playing Field. The Driver Station is exempt from this rule, but must be used only for operating the Robot.
*G2 = <G2> Pre-Match Robot Setup - At the beginning of a Match, each Alliance Robot must be set up on the Playing Field in accordance with section 1.5.1 Pre-Match. After Robots have been set up on the Playing Field, Drive Teams are required to stand Completely Inside the Alliance Station at the location (Station one or Station two) specified by the Qualification Match schedule.
a. During the Qualification Matches, the Blue Alliance Robots are set up on the Playing Field first, unless the Red Alliance waives their right to set up on the Playing Field second.
b. During the Elimination Matches, the lower seeded (e.g. 3rd seed is lower than 2nd seed) Alliance Robots are set up on the Playing Field first, unless the higher seeded Alliance waives their right to set up on the Playing Field second. Alliance color doesn't change the seeding of a Team during the Elimination Matches. If the 4th seed defeats the 1st seed in the Semi-Finals, they will still have to place their Robot on the field first in the Finals because their seeding will be lower than the 2nd or 3rd seed.
c. Teams may implicitly waive their right to place their Robots on the Playing Field last by placing their Robots on the Playing Field before or in conjunction with the opposing Alliance. There is no need to notify the referees; Teams waive their right by the act of placing their Robots on the Playing Field.
d. Teams that unnecessarily delay the beginning of a Match and/or field reset will incur a Minor Penalty for each offense. 
*G3 = <G3> Robot Starting Volume - Before the start of a Match, each Robot in its starting location must not exceed a volume of 45.7cm (18 inches) wide by 45.7cm (18 inches) long by 45.7cm (18 inches) tall. The Alliance identification flag and pre-loaded Scoring Elements may extend Outside the 45.7cm (18 inches) cube volume constraint. An offending Robot will be Disabled and powered off for the Match at the Head Referee's discretion and must remain on the Playing Field in its starting location for the length of the Match. After the start of a Match, the Robot may extend in any dimension unless restricted by the Game-Specific Rules detailed in Section 1.6.3.
*G4 = <G4> Robot Setup Alignment Devices - Alignment devices are allowed during pre-Match setup if they are constructed from legal components, they are part of the Robot, and remain Completely Inside the 45.7cm (18 inches) cube starting volume constraint during the set up process. A Minor Penalty will be assessed to the Team for violation of this rule.
The intent of this rule is to prohibit the use of devices external to the Robot and to prevent the extension of any object or tool Outside the 45.7cm (18 inches) cube starting volume. Humans standing on the other side of the field to aide in aligning the Robot are not allowed.
*G5 = <G5> Alliance Station - During a Match, the Drivers and Coach must remain Completely Inside their Alliance Station. The first instance of leaving the Alliance Station will result in a warning, with any following instances resulting in a Minor Penalty. Leaving the Alliance Station for safety reasons will not result in a warning or Penalty.
*G6 = <G6> Starting Game Play Early - Robots that start play of the game (Autonomous or Driver-Controlled Period) prior to competition personnel announcing the start of a Match period receive a Minor Penalty. Referees have the option of issuing a Major Penalty in place of the Minor Penalty if the early start results in a competitive advantage for the offending Alliance.
*G7 = <G7> Late Start of the Autonomous Period - Teams participating in the Autonomous Period are expected to press the "start with 30-second" button on their Driver Station Android Device and then place the Driver Station in a hands-off location without delay when field personnel signal the start of the Autonomous Period. A Minor Penalty is assessed for violating this rule. Referees have the option of issuing a Major Penalty in place of the Minor Penalty if the late start results in a competitive advantage for the offending Alliance. 
*G8 = <G8> Stopping Game Play Late - Robots that do not stop playing the game at the end of the Autonomous or Driver-Controlled Periods when competition personnel or timer software announce the end of a Match period receive a Minor Penalty and the actions of the Robot occurring after the end of a Match period do not count towards their Alliance's Score. Referees have the option of issuing a Major Penalty in place of the Minor Penalty if the late stop results in a competitive advantage (other than Scoring) for the offending Alliance.
Scoring Elements that were Launched before the end of the period are eligible to be counted as Scored. Other Robot Scoring achievements that occur after the announced end of the Autonomous Period and before the start of the Driver-Controlled Period do not count towards the Score for the Autonomous or Driver-Controlled Periods. Referees may remove any Scoring Elements from a goal that are improperly Scored in this manner.
The intent of this rule is for Robots to stop playing the game within a reasonable human reaction time following the start of the game sound (i.e. buzzer) signaling the end of the Match. Drive Teams should make their best effort to stop game play immediately when the end of Match game sound begins. Before the Penalties come into play, referees will use their discretion to give Drive Teams an approximate one second grace period following the conclusion of the game sound signaling the end of the Match for Robots to stop playing the game.
*G9 = <G9> Drive Team Contact with the Playing Field or Robot - During a Match, the Drivers and Coaches are prohibited from making contact with the Playing Field, any Game Element, or any Robot. The first instance of contact will result in a warning, with any following instances resulting in a Minor Penalty. Contact that affects Scoring and/or game play will result in issuance of a Yellow Card at the discretion of the referees. Contact with the Playing Field, a Game Element, or a Robot for safety reasons will not result in a warning or Penalty. 
For example, a Particle is launched from a Robot on the Playing Field and it Inadvertently hits a Team member in the Driver's Station and is deflected back onto the field. The Team would NOT receive a Penalty because the Team member was protecting him/herself (safety). However, if that same Particle is caught and/or directed to a specific location on the Playing Field, the Team may be issued a Penalty. 
*G10 = <G10> Autonomous to Driver-Controlled Period Transition - At the conclusion of the Autonomous Period the Head Referee at his or her discretion will untangle Robots, place Robots on their drivetrains, make minor adjustments to Robot position, etc. so that the Robots can participate in the Driver-Controlled portion of the Match. The referees will do this after finding out from the Drive Team where the best place is to touch their Robot to be moved or lifted. At this time, if a Robot has lost its Wi-Fi Direct connection to the Team's Driver Station or if it is locked-up, the Robot Controller can be restarted and power to the Robot may be reset under supervision of the Field Technical Advisor as long as the Match is not extraordinarily delayed. If the Robot is not controllable after attempts to get it working with the Team's Driver Station, it will be Disabled and remain in place on the Playing Field for the remainder of the Match.
When instructed by field personnel to do so, Drive Teams may use their Driver Station to select an Op Mode, initialize, start, and reset their Robot as appropriate. See Section 1.5 - Game Play for details. 
*G11 = <G11> Drive Team Coach Driver Station Control - During the Driver-Controlled Period, Robots must be remotely operated only by the Drivers using the Gamepads connected to the Team's Driver Station and/or by software running in the on-board Robot control system. The first instance of Coach controlling (e.g. operating a Gamepad) will result in a warning, with any following instances resulting in a Major Penalty. During the Driver-Controlled Period, Drive Team Coaches and/or Drivers are allowed to hold the Team's Driver Station Android Device and interact with it to select an Op Mode, view information displayed on the screen, and initialize, start, stop, and reset the Robot.
*G12 = <G12> Recording the Score After Objects Come to Rest - Referee scoresheets will be filled out at the end of the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods when all objects on the Playing Field have come to rest. A change in the state of a Game Element or Robot that occurs before a referee records the Score on the scoresheet will affect the Match Score. A change in state of a Game Element or Robot after its Score is recorded on the scoresheet will not change an already-recorded Score. 
*G13 = <G13> Robots Deliberately Detaching Parts - Robots may not deliberately detach parts during a Match, or leave mechanisms on the Playing Field. Consequence of deliberately detaching a part is a Minor Penalty if it does not Block an opposing Alliance Robot or goal. If a deliberately-detached component or mechanism affects gameplay by any Robot, the offending Robot will receive a Major Penalty and will be issued a Yellow Card. Robot parts that are released but remain connected by a tether and interfere with an opposing Alliance Robot are considered detached for the purposes of this rule. 
*G14 = <G14> Robots Grasping Game Elements - Robots may not grab, grasp and/or attach to any Game Element or structure other than Scoring Elements, unless specifically allowed by game-specific rule(s) listed in Section 1.6.3. The first instance will result in a warning with any following violations resulting in a Major Penalty.
*G15 = <G15> Destruction, Damage, Tipping, etc. - Strategies and/or mechanisms aimed solely at the destruction, damage, tipping over, or entanglement of Robots or Game Elements are not in the spirit of the FIRST Tech Challenge and are not allowed. However, FIRST Tech Challenge games are highly interactive and Robot-to-Robot contact and defensive game play should be expected. Some tipping, entanglement, and damage may occur as a part of normal game play. If the tipping, entanglement, or damage is ruled to be deliberate or chronic, the offending Team will receive a Major Penalty and a Yellow Card. 
*G16 = <G16> Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking Robots - A Robot cannot cause an opposing Alliance Robot to become Pinned, Trapped, or Blocked for more than five seconds. If a referee determines this rule is violated, the offending Alliance will receive a Minor Penalty for every five seconds that they are in violation. If a referee declares a Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking warning during the Match, the offending Robot must move away at least 0.9 m (3 feet), approximately 1.5 floor tiles, from the Pinned, Trapped, or Blocked Robot.
A Robot cannot incur this type of Penalty during the Autonomous Period unless it is determined by the Referee to be part of a deliberate strategy. If the violation happens during the Autonomous Period, the first action done by the offending Robot during the Driver-Controlled Period must be to move away from the Pinned, Trapped, or Blocked Robot or a Minor Penalty will be assessed immediately and again for every five seconds that they are in violation. Game-specific rule(s) listed in Section 1.6.3 that further define Pinning, Trapping, or Blocking take precedence over this general game rule.
*G17 = <G17> Forcing an Opponent to Break a Rule - The actions of an Alliance or their Robots shall not cause an opposing Alliance or Robot to break a rule and thus incur Penalties. Any forced rule violations committed by the affected Alliance shall be excused, and no Penalties will be assigned.
*G18 = <G18> Removing Game Elements from the Playing Field - Robots may not deliberately remove Game Elements from the Playing Field during a Match. Game Elements that incidentally fall Outside the Playing Field will be returned to the Playing Field by field personnel at the earliest safe and convenient opportunity. Game Elements removed from the Playing Field in an attempt to Score are also not subject to this Penalty. Teams deliberately removing Game Elements from the Playing Field will incur a Minor Penalty per Game Element removed from the Playing Field. Game-specific rule(s) listed in Section 1.6.3 that allow the removal of Scoring Elements from the Playing Field take precedence over this general game rule.
Game Elements removed from the Playing Field in an attempt to Score are not subject to this Penalty. For example, a Robot launches a Particle towards the Center Vortex. If that Particle exits the Playing Field having missed the Center Vortex, a Penalty will not be assessed.
*G19 = <G19> Scoring Elements in Contact with Robots - Scoring Elements that are in contact with a Robot on the corresponding Alliance for the Vortex have zero Score value when referees record the Score at the end of the Autonomous and Driver-Controlled Periods. Game-specific rule(s) listed in Section 1.6.3 that allow Robot contact with Scoring Elements take precedence over this general game rule.
*G20 = <G20> Post-Match Removal of Game Elements from Robots - Robots must be designed to permit easy removal of Game Elements from any grasping, containing, or holding mechanism after the Match. Robots should also be able to be removed from the Playing Field without damaging the Playing Field. A Minor Penalty will be assessed for violations of this rule.
The intent of this rule is to have timely removal of Robots from the Playing Field following a Match.
Drive Teams are expected to stage their Robots for a Match, and remove it from the Playing Field afterwards, safely and swiftly. Drive Team efforts that either intentionally or unintentionally delay the start of a Match or the
Field reset are not allowed. Examples include, but are not limited to:
Failing to exit the Playing Field once instructed by the Referee
Failing to remove Driver Stations in a timely manner
*G21 = <G21> Robot Manipulation of Scoring Elements - Scoring Elements that are Possessed by a Robot are considered to be part of the Robot.
*G22 = <G22> Robot or Scoring Elements In Two or More Scoring Areas - Robots or Scoring Elements that are In two or more Scoring Areas earn points only for the highest value achievement. If the achievement values are equal, only one achievement counts as Scored. Exceptions to this general rule may be specified in the Game Play section or in the game-specific rules.
*G23 = <G23> Disabled Robot Eligibility - If a referee Disables a Robot, it will not be eligible to Score or earn points for the remainder of the Match. A Disabled Robot (whether referee induced or failure) will not be able to earn penalties after becoming Disabled.
*G24 = <G24> Playing Field Tolerances - Playing Field and Game Elements will start each Match with tolerances that may vary by as much as +/-2.5cm (1.0 inch). Teams must design their Robots accordingly.
*G25 = <G25> Match Replay - Matches are replayed at the discretion of the Head Referee only for a failure of a Game Element or verified Wi-Fi interference that was likely to have impacted which Alliance won the Match.
Unexpected Robot behavior in itself will not result in a Match replay. Team-induced failures, such as low battery conditions, processor sleep time-outs, Robot mechanical/electrical/software/communication failures, etc. are NOT valid justifications for a replaying of a Match.
*G26 = <G26> Egregious Behavior - Egregious Robot or Team member behavior at the Playing Field, as determined by the referees, will result in a Major Penalty and issuance of a Yellow Card and/or Red Card. Subsequent violations will result in Team Disqualification from the tournament. Egregious behavior includes, but is not limited to, repeated and/or flagrant violation of game rules, unsafe behavior or actions, and uncivil behavior towards Drivers, Coaches, competition personnel, or event attendees.	
*GS1 = <GS1> Controlling/Possessing Particles - Once a Match begins, a Robot may Control or Possess any quantity of their Alliance's Particles.
*GS2 = <GS2> Particle Scoring Eligibility - After Scoring, Particles must make contact with the Playing Field Floor before they are eligible to be Scored again. Any Particles Scored in violation of this rule will have a Score value of zero (0).
*GS3 = <GS3> Corner Vortex Scoring Violations - Robots may not make contact with the Particle Return, break the vertical plane of the outside (facing the Playing Field Wall) vertical face of the Vortex Bar (see Figure 1.3-3), or interact with a Particle once it has been released through the Corner Vortex. Teams will be assessed a Minor Penalty for every occurrence of violating this rule. Actions that are Inadvertent and Inconsequential will not be Penalized. Robots are allowed to make contact with the Corner Vortex Wall.
*GS4 = <GS4> Drive Teams Touching Robots or Driver Stations after Beacon Randomization - Drive Teams are not allowed to touch or interact with their Robots or Driver Stations once field personnel have randomized the first Beacon. If this occurs, a Minor Penalty will be assessed per Robot and the affected Robots are not eligible to Claim a Beacon in the Autonomous Period. This Penalty only affects the offending Team. The non-offending Alliance Partner Robot remains eligible for the Beacon Scoring achievement.
*GS5 = <GS5> Drive Team or Robot Pressing the Beacon Randomization Button - Drive Teams and Robots are not allowed to press the randomization button (or power button if it exists) on the Beacon at any time. A Major Penalty will be assessed for violating this rule.
*GS6 = <GS6> Opposing Alliance's Beacon during Autonomous Period - Robots are not allowed to press the buttons on a Beacon located in the opposing Alliance's Area during the Autonomous Period. A Major Penalty will be assessed for violating this rule and the illegally Claimed Beacon will have zero Autonomous Score value for the offending Alliance. Bonus Particles will not be awarded to the offending Alliance as well. However, the non-offending Alliance remains eligible to earn a Beacon Score and bonus Particle. Field Personnel will randomize an illegally Claimed Beacon before the start of the Driver-Controlled Period.
*GS7 = <GS7> Autonomous Period Robot Keep Out Area - Robots may not go Inside the opposing Alliance's Area of the Playing Field during the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period. A Major Penalty will be assessed for violating this rule and any Scoring that occurs in the opposing Alliance's Area by the offending Robot will not benefit the offending Alliance. The red and blue gaffers tape on the Playing Field Floor bisects the Playing Field into equal-sized Alliance Areas. Robots may enter the black painted Area of the Center Vortex Base at any time.
The intent of this rule is to delay the start of defensive strategies by requiring Robots to stay Completely Inside their Alliance's Area during the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period. The unpredictability of events during the Autonomous Period may result in unintentional entry into the opposing Alliance Area. For example, Robot collisions may result in an Inadvertent ingress into the opposing Alliance Area. Ingress into the opposing Alliance Area that is Inadvertent and Inconsequential will not be Penalized. Entering into the opposing Alliance Area during the first ten seconds of the Autonomous Period that results in an Alliance gaining an advantage is not Inconsequential nor Inadvertent and it will be Penalized.
*GS8 = <GS8> Robot Height - Robots may not extend higher than 29 inches (73.6 cm), the approximate clearance height of the Center Vortex Particle deflector, except during the End Game. An immediate Minor Penalty will be assessed per occurrence for violating this rule. Additional Minor Penalties will be assessed for each five second interval that this situation continues.
The height of the Alliance Flag is not subject to this rule. However, the height of Possessed Scoring Elements are considered to be part of the Robot and is subject to this rule.
*GS9 = <GS9> Particle Interference - A Particle that has been fully released from a Robot (i.e. it is not in contact with any part of the Robot that released it) and is above 18 inches (45.7 cm) from the Playing Field with a  realistic intention of Scoring into any of the Vortexes may NOT be intentionally interfered with by an opposing Alliance's Robot. Each interfered Particle will be awarded the points it would have received had it Scored. A Particle that contacts an opposing Alliance Robot after a missed Scoring attempt in a Vortex is not protected by this rule.
Mechanisms designed for the sole purpose of interfering with launched Particles are prohibited.
Repeated or continued violations of this rule are likely to escalate to issuance of Yellow Cards rapidly (i.e. the threshold for egregious or repeated violations is relatively low).
It is expected that Particles will collide in mid-air. If that happens, there will not be Penalty. This rule is intended to insure that Robots do not block Particles in the air with mechanisms on the Robot.
*GS10 = <GS10> Controlling or Blocking an Opposing Alliance's Scoring Elements - Robots may not Control or Block Access to the opposing Alliance's Cap Ball or Particles. The first instance will result in a warning with any following violations resulting in a Major Penalty and an additional Minor Penalty assessed for every five seconds that the rule violation persists. If the referee declares a Blocking Access warning during the Driver Controlled Period, the offending Robot must move away at least 0.9 m (3 feet), approximately 1.5 floor tiles from the Blocked Scoring Element.
The intent of this rule is to allow Teams access to and from their Scoring Elements. Blocking and Trapping means denying ALL access, so general Robot movement with respect to other Robots should not be considered in violation unless there is no other way to traverse the Playing Field or get the Scoring Element. Also note that this rule requires attempted action on the part of the opposing Alliance. See also Rule <G16>.
*GS11 = <GS11> Cap Ball Interference - During the End Game, Robots may not interfere with an opposing Alliance Robot that Possesses a lifted Cap Ball above the Playing Field Floor. A Major Penalty will be assessed per occurrence for violating this rule and a Minor Penalty will be assessed for every five seconds that the condition persists.
The intent of this rule is to allow Robots to Score the Cap Ball without interference. A Robot interaction with an opposing Alliance Robot may be ruled at the referee's discretion to be Inconsequential and Inadvertent and will not be Penalized.
*GS12 = <GS12> De-Scoring a Capped Center Vortex - Robots may not de-Score an opposing Alliance's Capped Center Vortex during the Driver-Controlled Period. The offending Alliance will be assessed two Major Penalties for violating this rule.
*GS13 = <GS13> Blocking an Opposing Alliance's Center Vortex - A Robot may not place any Cap Ball or Robot part In the opposing Alliance's Center Vortex. A Major Penalty and Yellow Card will be assessed and additional Minor Penalties will be assessed every five seconds for the remainder of the Match or until the blockage is removed by the offending Alliance.
*GS14 = <GS14> Blocking Access to an Opposing Alliance's Corner Vortex - During the Driver-Controlled Period, a Robot may not obstruct ALL access, prevent a Robot from escaping, or interfere with the opposing Alliance's Corner Vortex when an opposing Alliance Robot is actively attempting to access or escape from it. The offending Alliance will immediately incur a Minor Penalty. Additional Minor Penalties will be assessed for every five seconds that the condition persists. Repeated or continued violations of this rule are likely to escalate to issuance of Yellow Cards rapidly (i.e. the threshold for egregious or repeated violations is relatively low).
The intent of this rule is to allow reasonable Robot ingress and egress to an Alliance's Corner Vortex. A Robot In an opposing Alliance Corner Vortex that is not Inconsequential and Inadvertent is Blocking Access and it will be Penalized. Driving in front of the opposing Alliance's Corner Vortex while the opponent is not trying to Score there can be considered Inconsequential and Inadvertent.
*GS15 = <GS15> Starting the End Game Achievements Early - Robots may not Intentionally perform any End Game scoring achievements prior to the start of the End Game. A Robot that begins the End Game achievements early will cause the Alliance to lose the right to Score those achievements. Intentional Controlled movement of an Alliance's own Cap Ball is allowed at all times.
The intent of this rule is to prevent Robots from deliberately starting the End Game achievements early. The movement of Robots around the Playing Field will likely cause the Cap Balls to make Inadvertent contact with a Corner Vortex or to rise slightly above the Playing Field floor tiles during normal game play. These and similar Inadvertent and Inconsequential actions will not be Penalized.
*GS16 = <GS16> Cap Balls in Contact with a Robot - Cap Balls in contact with a Robot on any Alliance remain eligible to be counted as Scored. If a Cap Ball that Caps a Center Vortex is in contact with the Robot on the corresponding Alliance, it will only count as being at the Low or High Height for the purposes of Scoring.
